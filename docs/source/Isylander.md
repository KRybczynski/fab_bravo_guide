## Isylander 
### Overwiew
Cards that generate over the curve value, mixture of physical and arcane damage and disrupts make Isylander difficult matchup. She plays card in our turn, so it's good to know best and worst possible scenario when making decision.
### General tips
* ALWAYS go first. Chances of winnig inceases dramaticly when we get a chance of going first. Even 3 damage can make huge difference. 
* Get the most value out of every card. Even if it means overblocking
* Don't give her a chance to response to any trigger before making an attack. So don't make any aura that triggers at the beggining of the turn
* Try to reveal as little informations about your hand as possible. Give har chance to overblock or cast spell that makes little to none effect
### Good cards agaist
1. Zelous belting
With 3 card hand we can go zelous + hammer for 6, even if we get a frostbite. We can also use it to bluff blue hand, and make her turn worse by commiting to blocko
2. Pummel
Can turn hammer for 4 to hammer for 10. Works even if we get a frostbite
3.  Sigil of solace
Good card against Frosthex. By paying to cast it against frostbite we avoid Frosthex damage and gain life. It cost nothing to put it in arsenal and bluff big attack or pummel
4. Sink below/Fate forseen
Hand fixing, block for 4. Has a lot of attack going for 7, 8 or 4 and it's way better than some attacks
5.
